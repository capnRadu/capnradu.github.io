                <h3 style="font-style: italic ;">Assignment Criteria</h3>
                <p1>'Bos', previously known as 'Living Isle', is the second game project completed during the second semester of the year. The assignment entailed
                    developing a Unity 3D game that fulfilled one of the nine specified cases. Collaborating with a team of five other members, we selected the
                    'Wildlife' case at the beginning of the semester. Our client, Staatsbosbeheer National Forest Service, sought a tool to raise children's awareness
                    about the diverse wildlife inhabiting their national parks. While the target audience focused on children, the product aimed to broaden their
                    understanding that humans are an integral part of the natural world. The requirements necessary for this project were to conduct and evaluate
                    research done with the target audience, use game design tools, such as game design documents and one-pagers, and develop a publishable game.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-style: italic ;">Work Method</h3>
                <p1>The project marked a significant milestone in my skill development. I took charge of programming the core mechanics, laying the foundation for
                    Android mechanics, which another team member later refined and enhanced. Additionally, I contributed to world-building efforts and implemented
                    sound effects. Among the mechanics I developed were camera drag and rotation, upgrade system, income system, and animal unlock system. My team
                    focused on various aspects of the game, including UI design, modeling, wireframing, gameplay loop, narrative, and conducting research. Throughout
                    the development process, we organized our tasks into weekly sprint sessions and held daily stand-ups to monitor progress. Our aim was to create
                    an idle game that captivated and engaged children, highlighting the diverse wildlife found in the Netherlands.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-style: italic ;">Gameplay</h3>
                <p1>The goal of the game is to build a healthy ecosystem together with the animals you meet, and learn about their strengths!
                    The more animals you help, the wealthier the environment becomes. Interact with animals, discover their needs, and decorate their habitats! The
                    unique selling points are the creative decoration of the animal lots, the number of animals and upgrades, and the information about the animals.

                <h3 style="font-style: italic ;">How does the game meet the criteria?</h3>
                <p1>Our product aims to provide an immersive experience that captivates players through actions that involve helping animals and their wildlife. We
                    carefully designed the gameplay to strike a balance where it engages children without promoting excessive dependence on the game, discouraging
                    extended periods of indoor play. To address this concern, we implemented a mechanic that restricts access to the game unless a code provided by
                    a Statsbosbeheer forest ranger is entered. This encourages children to explore the real-life wildlife and fosters a connection to nature.
                    In addition, our product caters specifically to children by incorporating adorable animal characters, a vibrant world with nature-inspired colors,
                    an easily comprehensible user interface, and a visually appealing comic-like environment achieved with the assistance of shaders. These elements
                    collectively create an experience that is both entertaining and educational, stimulating children's awareness of wildlife while keeping them
                    engaged in a child-friendly setting.
