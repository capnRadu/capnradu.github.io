                <h2>Unity 3D Game Project</h2>
                <h2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 25px;">'Living Isle'</h2>
                <br>
                <p1>'Living Isle' is the second game that I programmed for a university assigment, and at the moment it is in development. The project spans over the second
                    semester of the first year, and it should be finished before 13th June. The project assignment is to develop a 3D game that answers a requirement for one of
                    the nine possible cases. I am working in a team with five other members, and at the beginning of the semester we chose the 'wildlife' case. Our client,
                    Staatsbosbeheer National Forest Service, requires a tool that will help raise children's awareness of the animals living in their national parks. The target 
                    audience consists of children, and the product doesn't necessarily have to focus exclusively on animals, as long as it helps to make children more aware that
                    people are part of the wider natural world. The requirements necessary for this project are to conduct and evaluate research done with the target audience, 
                    use game design tools, such as game design documents and one pagers, and develop a publishable game.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>For this project, I help at programming the mechanics and the game itself, while my team is working on the UI, models, wireframe, gameplay loop, narrative, and conducted
                    research. During these months in which we are developing the game, we organize our tasks in weekly sprint sessions, and daily stand-ups to check-in with our
                    progress. Our idea was to develop an idle game, in order to gain and maintain childrens' attention, about the wildlife present in the Netherlands. The goal
                    of the game is to collect all the animals present by completing their needs, and learn about their role in nature while collecting resources from their idle
                    stations. In the beginning, you start with the worm, and from there you can expand the wildlife by collecting eight more animals and complete their tasks.</p1>

                <p1>We are constantly updating the game, so I am uploading all the versions until the finished one! Download and play the game:</p1>
