                <h2>GameMaker 2D Game Project - PC</h2>
                <h2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 25px;">'Get your shit together!' (Programmer)</h2>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-style: italic ;">Assignment Criteria</h3>
                <p1>This project was my first journey into game programming. The task was to create a game tailored for first-year international students preparing
                    to study abroad. The core concept revolved around 'wayfinding'—a guide to help newcomers navigate their new environment, adapt to different
                    people, and embrace a new lifestyle. Two additional requirements included fostering intercultural competence, allowing players to learn about
                    themselves and others, and integrating design ethics from Chris Nodder's book 'Evil by Design: Interaction Design to Lead Us into Temptation.'
                    To fulfill these objectives, we utilized GameMaker Studio 2, my initial experience with a game engine.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-style: italic ;">Work Method</h3>
                <p1>I was in a project group with four other members, and I was assigned the programmer role. My team created all of the assets and UI elements present in the game,
                    and I tied everything up together, alongside developing the mechanics included and the gameplay loop, to create the final product, 'Get your shit together!'. During the seven weeks in which we developed
                    the game, we used Trello for SCRUM sprints and stand-ups, in order for us to be updated with each other's tasks; I would work on new mechanics or improve the game, and
                    ask for feedback from my team to see if everything was corresponding with our vision.</p1>
                <br> 
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-style: italic ;">Story</h3>
                <p1>The story of the game is that you, the main character, started your studies at 'Happy University', and you must find your way in the city maze, in order to
                    reach at the University. What's more is that you have to work on yourself and improve aspects of your life in order to beat the maze. On the path, you will
                    encounter new people that will help you escape the maze, and learn new things about the adventure you emarked on. There are three main NPC's that you have to
                    talk to, and they will each give you a task to accomplish in order to progress further in the maze. These represent common tasks a student can encounter while
                    pursuing their studies and living alone. Once all the tasks are completed and you gain all the useful insights from the NPC's, you are ready to exit the maze
                    and confidently embrace the student life.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3 style="font-style: italic ;">How does the game meet the criteria?</h3>
                <p1>The wayfinding aspect of the game is symbolized by the maze, representing the challenges an international student faces when beginning their
                    studies in a foreign country. The maze serves as a metaphor for the anxieties of living independently, meeting new peers, finding accommodation,
                    managing finances, and self-discovery. To enhance this metaphor, a black and white filter overlays the protagonist's life initially, reflecting a
                    sense of dullness and uncertainty. However, as players progress through tasks and gain insights from the NPC's, the world gradually regains color,
                    representing personal growth and transformation. The intercultural competence requirement is fulfilled through the three key NPC's, known as
                    "failed students." Despite their failures, these characters provide valuable lessons about student life and its obstacles. By interacting with
                    them, the main character learns about the nuances of the student experience and gains intercultural understanding. The term "failed students"
                    highlights the notion that failure can lead to valuable insights and personal growth.</p1>
