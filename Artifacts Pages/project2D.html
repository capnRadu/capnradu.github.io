                <h2>GameMaker 2D Game Project</h2>
                <h2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 25px;">'Get your shit together!'</h2>
                <br>
                <p1>This project represents the first game I have programmed. The project assigment was to develop a game that would be suitable for first-year international
                    students who will go abroad in order to live and study in a foreign country. Thus, the main theme of this concept was 'wayfinding'; our product should be used
                    as a guide for new students that have to adapt to a new environment, new people, and a new life style. The other two requirements were to include intercultural
                    competence, so the players would learn something about themselves and others by playing the game, and design ethics from the book 'Evil by Design: Interaction
                    Design to Lead Us into Temptation' by Chris Nodder. In addition to this, we were required to use GameMaker Studio 2, which was the first game engine I
                    experimented with.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>I was in a project group with four other members, and I was assigned the programmer role. They created all of the assets and UI elements present in the game,
                    and I tied everything up together, with the mechanics included, to create the final product, 'Get your shit together!'. During the weeks in which we developed
                    the game, we used Scrum sprints and stand-ups, in order for us to be updated with each other's tasks. I would work on new mechanics or improve the game, and
                    ask for feedback from my team to see if everything was corresponding with our vision.</p1>
                <br> 
                <br>
                <p1>The story of the game is that you, the main character, started your studies at 'Happy University', and you must find your way in the city maze, in order to
                    reach at the University. What's more is that you have to work on yourself and improve aspects of your life in order to beat the maze. On the path, you will
                    encounter new people that will help you escape the maze, and learn new things about the adventure you emarked on. There are three main NPC's that you have to
                    talk to, and they will each give you a task to accomplish in order to progress further in the maze. These represent common tasks a student can encounter while
                    pursuing their studies and living alone. Once all the tasks are completed and you gain all the useful insights from the NPC's, you are ready to exit the maze
                    and confidently embrace the student life.</p1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p1>The wayfinding aspect of the game is represented by the maze the player has to escape. This maze can be considered a metaphor for how an international student
                    perceives the student life in a foreign country before their studies; anxiety from living alone for the first time, meeting new peers in an unknown community,
                    finding a place to live in, dealing with taxes, rent, healthcare, and discovering themselves and their purpose. This metaphor is furthermore nuanced by the black and
                    white filter that takes over the main character's life. In the beginning, everything is washed out and dull, but once the player progresses through the tasks and
                    learns about the insights from the NPC's, the world slowly regains color. The intercultural competence requirement is accomplished by the three main NPC's that
                    help the main character progress through life. These NPC's are called 'failed students' because, as the name suggests, they failed during their student adventure.
                    But because failure brings new insights, they help the main character learn something about the student life, and its roadblocks.</p1>
