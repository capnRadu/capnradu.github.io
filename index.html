                <p1>My name is Radu Duicu, also known by my online alias, "capnRadu." At the age of seven, I embarked on an exciting gaming journey that introduced
                    me to classics like Counter-Strike 1.6 and Minecraft. Since then, I've continuously immersed myself in various gaming genres, forging new
                    connections, and cultivating enduring friendships that endure to this day.<br><br> During my high school years, my interest in programming and
                    editing began to grow. Over the four years, I honed my skills in C++ and fostered a foundation of critical thinking. While solving coding
                    challenges was enjoyable, I craved a means to channel my creativity through programming. This led me to question how lines of code could culminate
                    in a captivating gaming experience on people's screens. Concurrently, I delved into the realm of editing software, such as Photoshop and Sony
                    Vegas, initially for personal amusement. As time progressed, I honed my proficiency in these tools, relishing the hours I dedicated to each
                    project.<br><br> With a passion for programming firmly established, I made the decision to pursue computer science in my home country, Romania.
                    However, upon reflection, I realized that this field did not wholly satisfy my aspirations. Nevertheless, certain courses provided invaluable
                    knowledge, particularly in Python and computing systems architecture by experimenting with x86 Assembly, nurturing my critical thinking
                    aptitude.<br><br> My journey ultimately led me to Hanze University of Applied Sciences, where I am currently nearing the completion of my first
                    year. Here, I have been exposed to game industry programs and have had the privilege of collaborating with exceptional individuals on group
                    projects. It is within this environment that I have undeniably discovered my true passion.</p1>
